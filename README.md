##Game Overview

Outsmarted is a fast-paced, real-time 1v1 online trivia game where two players face off across three intense rounds. In each round, both players receive the same question and must decide whether to answer it themselves or attempt to steal their opponent's answer. A correct answer earns 1 point, but a successful steal yields 2 points — while a failed steal results in a penalty of –1 point. After both players make their choices, the results are revealed.
